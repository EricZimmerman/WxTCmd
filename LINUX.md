# Building WxTCmd on Linux

Recent changes have allowed WxTCmd to run natively on Linux. This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and .NET 9

In order to do this you will need to download .NET 9 SDK on Linux. I followed the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-install?tabs=dotnet9&pivots=os-linux-ubuntu-2404). 

In the case of Ubuntu, you will need to install build-essential if you wish to compile the `libSQLite.Interop.so` yourself by doing sudo apt-get update and sudo apt install build-essential

If you have issues with the bundled `libSQLite.Interop.so` the steps to build your own are as follows:
Download the source code for the library by navigating [here](https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki) and downloading the one that says `sqlite-netFx-full-source-1.0.119.0.zip`

Uncompress the zip file and issue the following commands in a Linux terminal:
```
cd LOCATIONOFSOURCE/Setup
chmod +x compile-interop-assembly-release.sh
./compile-interop-assembly-release.sh
```
Now, you will have a freshly built library file called libSQLite.Interop.so in the `LOCATIONOFSOURCE/bin/2013/Release/bin` folder.

Download the WxTCmd source code if you haven't already [here](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/WxTCmd/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and copy and replace the `libSQLite.Interop.so` file located in `WxTCmd/Dependencies/x64/libSQLite.Interop.so`

To build the native Linux Binary, issue the following commands in a Linux terminal:
```
cd LOCATIONOFWXTCMDMASTERFOLDER - This will have WxTCmd.sln 
dotnet publish -f net9.0 -r linux-x64
```

When this finishes, the resulting files will be located in `LOCATIONOFWXTCMDMASTERFOLDER/WxTCmd/bin/Release/net9.0/linux-x64/publish`
All you need to do is copy these files to another folder and run it in terminal with `./WxTCmd`
